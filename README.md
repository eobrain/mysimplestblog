# Simplest Blog

Create a blog by editing markdown files.

Simple instructions to see a demo:

1. Fork this repo
2. At command line:
  ```sh
  nvm use
  npm install
  npm run demo
  ```
3. To create your own entries, edit the markdown files in `content/posts` and `content/pages` and then at the command line:
  ```sh
  npm start
  ```

A simple way to publish your blog is to `git push` it to GitHub and then use GiyHub pages to host your blog directly from your repo.
