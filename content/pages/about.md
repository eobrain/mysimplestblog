I'm Éamonn, a software engineering manager working on privacy UI at Google, but the opinions posted here are strictly my own — I'm definitely not speaking for Google.

My team aims to increase transparency and control of user data, giving users more agency over their privacy. We can this thanks to robust privacy law enforcement in some jurisdictions, which ensures our work is a company priority. We also go beyond mere compliance and are guided by UX research on users' privacy needs and expectations.

One particular interest of mine is finding ways to protect vulnerable people who could be seriously harmed by the wrong people seeing their data.

I've long believed that the UX privacy problem is one of the hardest problems in software. I think we are finally making some progress.

As a manager, I find great engineers who understand privacy issues and support them as they grow in their careers.
