I just updated my profile descriptions (on [Mastodon][1], [Threads][2], [Bluesky][3], and [this blog][4]) to clearly acknowledge that I work at Google.

Given what I write about is sometimes directly or indirectly related to my employer it seemed better to unambiguously disclose where I work, while still emphasizing that the opinions I post are strictly my own and that I am in no way speaking on behalf of Google.

The fact that my employer is Google also explains a lacuna in my writing. I don't reveal anything that is company-confidential. You are not going to find out any juicy secrets about Google Search that will help you with your SEO!

But otherwise, especially in the area of privacy and regulation, I'll sometimes be writing about things that Google agrees with and sometimes not.
