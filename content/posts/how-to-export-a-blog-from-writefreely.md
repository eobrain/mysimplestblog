[WriteFreely][1] is a fantastic minimalist blogging platform with Fediverse integration. If you're self-hosting WriteFreely (like this blog!), it's wise to maintain backups for peace of mind. Here's how to export your WriteFreely blog using a tool I created called [writefreely-export][2].

## Prerequisites:

1. Shell access to your WriteFreely server
2. Node.js installed (I recommend using nvm for managing Node.js versions â€“ [installation instructions here][3])

## Steps:

Clone the repository and cd into it:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/eobrain/writefreely-export.git
cd writefreely-export
```
Ensure Node.js compatibility (if using nvm):

```sh
nvm use
```

Finally to do the export do

```sh
npm install
npm run export
```

This creates a `content` directory containing Markdown files of your WriteFreely posts.

## Using the Exported Files

One option is to import your Markdown files into a static site generator like [simplestblog][4]. This approach gives you a static backup and an alternate site. For example, this blog is mirrored at [mysimplestblog][5].

## Additional Notes:

Consider automating the export process for regular backups.
