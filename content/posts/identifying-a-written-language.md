Here's a cheat sheet that you can use to determine what language you are looking at:

![Language Phenotype Tree][1]

This is only for European languages that use a Latin-based alphabet.

It was adapted from the original diagram [What European language am I reading? European language flowchart][2] by [mel_afefon][3] which was based on [What European language am I reading? A flow chart][4] by @oysteib@masto.ai . 

I call this a “phenotype” tree because it represents the visual appearance of the languages, and is distinct from the true tree of how these languages are related. Some languages are close to one another in this phenotype tree because they borrowed alphabets from neighboring or hegemonic languages, despite being from very different language families.
