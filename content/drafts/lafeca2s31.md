You may not know what growth hacking is, but you will have seen its results in your apps and websites. You will have seen deceptive "dark patterns" that nudge you towards choices you regret, you will have seen algorithmic feeds that suck you into time-wasting rabbit holes, and you will have seen clickbait headlines that entice you to websites full of scammy ads.

Growth hacking is the dark side of behavioral economics, which was the revolution in the academic world when economists finally acknowledged the obvious fact that people are not fully rational actors. All the positive examples of the applications of behavioral economics were touted. For example, making retirement accounts opt-out rather than opt-in resulted in more people having retirement security, even though rationally there was no difference in the choices available to them.
