title: A Different Privacy Paradox: Why More Personalization Can Mean Better Privacy

Personalization seems to conflict with privacy, because if a web or mobile app has personalized features then it uses your personal data.

However, even if an app is not personalized it is likely using your personal data anyway for advertising. So non-personalized apps have a transparency problem. They are using your personal data, but you are probably not aware of it.

If the app has personalized features, then it is more clear that the app is collecting and using your personal data. Now you have more transparency. You will be aware of the use of your personal data, and so might be motivated to use the app’s settings to control personalization and protect your privacy.


That’s not to say that there are not risks from personalization, including the danger of people getting trapped in filter bubbles which can cause both personal and societal harm, as we have seen in the last decade. At a minimum, personalization should be transparent and controllable, And depending on the nature of the app, there should be protections against getting into filter bubbles.

So there is a principled case for personalization from a privacy advocates point of view, as long as the personalization is done in a transparent and controllable way.

And of course, presumably, the personalization has some value to you, should you choose to enable it.  So it’s a win-win.
